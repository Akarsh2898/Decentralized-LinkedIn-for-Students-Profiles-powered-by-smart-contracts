# Decentralized LinkedIn for Students

## Description

The **Decentralized LinkedIn for Students** is a blockchain-powered professional networking platform built on the Aptos blockchain using Move smart contracts. This innovative platform enables students to create verified academic profiles and build professional networks through peer endorsements, all stored immutably on the blockchain.

The smart contract allows students to:
- Create comprehensive academic profiles with university details, majors, skills, and contact information
- Endorse fellow students' profiles to build credible professional networks
- Maintain transparent, tamper-proof records of their academic and professional achievements

Unlike traditional centralized platforms, this decentralized approach ensures data ownership remains with students, eliminates single points of failure, and provides cryptographic proof of endorsements and achievements.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize how students build and showcase their professional identities in the digital age. We aim to create a trustless, transparent ecosystem where:

- **Students own their data** - No central authority controls or monetizes student information
- **Credibility is verifiable** - All endorsements and achievements are cryptographically secured
- **Global accessibility** - Any student worldwide can participate without geographical restrictions
- **Future-proof networking** - Blockchain-based profiles that students control throughout their careers 

- **Meritocracy prevails** - Skills and achievements are validated by peers, not algorithms

By leveraging blockchain technology, we're building the foundation for a new era of professional networking that prioritizes transparency, ownership, and genuine peer validation.

## Future Scope
